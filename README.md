# Probabilistic-Weather-Prediction
Weather prediction is a complex task in atmospheric science. This project uses conditional probability and a Naive Bayes model to predict rain based on features like humidity, temperature, and pressure using Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, and SciPy.
