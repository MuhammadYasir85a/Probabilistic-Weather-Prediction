# Probabilistic-Weather-Prediction
Weather prediction is one of the most complex and impactful applications of statistical modeling in the field of atmospheric sciences. Recent advancements in probabilistic meteorology have shown that conditional probability models can effectively forecast precipitation events by analyzing intricate relationships among atmospheric variables such as temperature, humidity, air pressure, and wind speed (Johnson & Martinez, 2024).

This project adopts a statistical approach to weather prediction using Python, leveraging powerful data science libraries:
- NumPy for efficient numerical computations
- Pandas for robust data manipulation and analysis
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for rich and interactive data visualizations
- SciPy for advanced statistical operations and probability modeling

By combining empirical analysis with a Naive Bayes classification model, this project demonstrates how conditional probabilities can be harnessed to estimate the likelihood of rain based on real-world weather data.
